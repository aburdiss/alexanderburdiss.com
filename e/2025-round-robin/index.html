          Registration is limited to the first 16 people. The first 16 people to

          tournament.

          For the initial pool play, games will be randomly assigned to each
          player in the bracket. Players will never play the same game twice.
          Each player placing 1st place will receive 3 points. Each player
          placing 2nd place will receive 2 points. Each player placing 1st place
          will receive 1 point. The highest 4 scores after 3 games will be
          placed in a championship match.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Final, Championship match will use one of the Championship games,
          chosen randomly
        </p>
        <p>
          The details for the tournament (including game selection) are subject
          to change.

        <h2><span>General Rules</span></h2>
        <p>Practice good sportsmanship at all times.</p>
        <p>
          When spectating games, you may not make any comments about the
          gameplay itself that may help either player.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any individual found to be cheating will be removed from the
          tournament and will have any winnings won so-far forfeited.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each match, players will agree to a random method of choosing the
          first player (coin flip, dice roll, etc.). This will decide the first
          player, regardless of what the game's rules state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players are responsible for helping other players remember to trigger
          mandatory effects (i.e. Once between turns powers in Wingspan,
          re-lighting your campfire in PARKS, or remembering to add cards to the
          clearing when trees are played in Forest Shuffle).
        </p>
        <p>
          Errors can only be corrected if all players agree, or if a referee
          decides it can be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          A player can resign by saying "I resign," but this is highly
          discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event where you realize an illegal play has taken place, and no
          immediate resolution can be agreed upon by both players, players will
          reset the game and begin from the beginning, with the player who did
          not make the illegal move deciding first player.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a rules clarification or dispute, players will call a
          referee to resolve the dispute. The referee will be clearly declared
          and agreed upon before gameplay begins.

          <li>
            We will be playing with the base Carcassone game, scoring only
            Knights (cities), Travelers (roads), Monks (monastaries), and
            Farmers (fields).
          </li>
          <li>
            Cities with two tiles give four points (not two). The Farmer's value
            is calculated like this: for every meadow the number of farmers is
            calculated and the player(s) with the most farmers receives 3 points
            for every city at that meadow.
          </li>
          <li>
            During your opponent's turn you may choose and look at your next
            tile. The new tile has to be above the tabletop at all times, so it
            is clear which one you've chosen.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of an "edge of the table" event you can rearange the tiles
            in the other direction to get more space. If this is not working we
            will provide another table to solve the problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's not allowed to make any private notes during the game (like
            counting tiles on a sheet of paper).

            When choosing one or more opponents to banish, potentially banish,
            or steal a card from their hand without the immediate ability to
            regain a card, you may only choose players who have more cards in
            hand than their starting hand (most starting hands are 5 cards; for
            House Ceres it’s 6). You can still deploy cards with such abilities,
            but any abilities related to choosing an opponent won’t trigger.
            This applies to Aja, Antonia, Arlus, Karnus, Roque, and Tactus.
