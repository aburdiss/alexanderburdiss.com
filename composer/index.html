                Reflections is a work for string quartet that embodies the
                ambiguity of human memory, and reflections upon those memories.
                A theme is played, and when it is repeated it isn’t quite how
                you remembered it. The whole work is also in a rondo form, where
                the second half of the piece “mirrors” the first half. The
                “mirror” in the middle of the work is also a reflection of the
                original theme, but shown in a new harmonic context, showing how
                a memory can be seen in very different lights depending on how
                it is framed. Overall, the work tries to capture how ambiguous
                our memories and thoughts can be, and intrigue the listener with
                the same kind of wonder that so frequently enthralls the
                composer.

                Rejuvenation is a short work for trombone quartet that embodies
                the feelings of accomplishment when someone completes a large
                task. This refreshing work was written to be one of the last
                compositions that the composer would perform during his
                undergraduate music degree. The main theme of this work is
                influenced by American Patriotic songs and composers, and
                blossoms into a broad, majestic climax that showcases the tone
                of four trombonists playing at high volumes. This work is
                dedicated to the composer’s instructor and mentor, David Vining.

            <h3>Werthner Woods</h3>
            <p>Premiered May 9, 2024 by the Anthem School Band, Anthem, AZ</p>
            <p>
              “Werthner Woods” is a short programatic work for an intermediate
              middle school band (Grade 1.5 - 2). Each section of the band gets
              to play the melody at some point, and the texture is constantly
              changing throughout the work. A slow and lyrical piece with an
              enjoyable and memorable melody, this work is sure to make a great
              contemporary classical addition to any intermediate middle school
              band program.

            <h3>By The Lake</h3>
            <p>
              Premiered May 3, 2023 by the Greenspun Jr. High School Band,
              Henderson, NV
            </p>
            <p>
              “By The Lake” is a short programatic work for an advanced middle
              school band (Grade 2.5). The work is in a rondo form, and heavily
              features the low brass, playing a leading role in the ensemble.
              While no one part is exceedingly difficult in this work, the real
              challenge for a middle school band playing this is the
              independence of each part. To perform this well, each musician
              must gain the confidence required to play without the rest of the
              section, as parts frequently enter and exit alone, and without the
              rest of their section. This independent playing is a skill that
              will help musicians throughout their career.
