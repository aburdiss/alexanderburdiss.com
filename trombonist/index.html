        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <div class="inner-content body">
          <p>
            I have played the trombone since I was 11, and have been playing
            solos since I was 15. I have devoted most of my life to learning the
            craft, and have loved every second of it. When I make music, I want
            my audiences to be able to connect with the music. I want to make
            complex musical pieces more accessible to all, and to bring live
            music back into the world of the common man, because I believe that
            a lot of modern music has become less about the music, and more
            about accompanying the lyrics that go with it, or has become so
            intellectual that if the listener cannot understand what is
            happening if they are not a musician. It is my aim to try to play
            music so full of energy, and in a way that will enhance the lives of
            every audience member I play for.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that being honest in what I do as a musician is the most
            valuable asset that I can possess. Playing in a way that only I can
            play makes me stand out from the crowd, and allows me to speak with
            my true voice. In my past, I have played too many shows where I am
            concentrated solely on the notes coming out, and I feel I have been
            unprepared in my earlier shows. The first time I actually felt
            prepared for a show was for a recital in college. I stepped out
            onstage with my music memorized (I felt over-prepared at the time)
            and I just tried to play something the audience would enjoy instead
            of trying to play all the notes right. By doing so I have found a
            way to play more expressively, be more true to myself, and
            ultimately play better than I ever have before.
